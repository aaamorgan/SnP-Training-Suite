# SnP-Training-Suite
## Description
The Sip 'N Puff (SnP) training suite emulates a SnP alt-drive for power wheelchairs. It reads in pressure values and outputs a state that is one of: hard sip, soft sip, nothing, soft puff, and hard puff. These states can be used to interface with other programs. 
## Setup
The Emulator currently requires the serial input to come from port '/dev/ttyACM0', which means it must be run in a linux environment.
